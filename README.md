# Speaker-Diarization-assignment(Coding Assignment-1)
This repository contains implementations and evaluations of various speaker diarization solutions, exploring both audio-based tonal analysis and NLP-based contextual understanding. Speaker diarization, the process of partitioning an audio stream into segments corresponding to individual speakers, plays a crucial role in applications like call center analytics, forensics, and speech recognition systems.
